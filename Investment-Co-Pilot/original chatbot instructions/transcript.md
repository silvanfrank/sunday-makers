Title: John Y. Campbell: Fixing Personal Finance | Rational Reminder 380

() 

(0:03) [Music]

(0:08) This is the Rational Reminder podcast, a weekly reality check on sensible investing and financial decision-making

(0:13) from two Canadians. We are hosted by me, Benjamin Felix, chief investment officer, and Cameron Pasmore, chief

(0:18) executive officer at PWL Capital. Welcome to episode 380.

(0:25) And this week's conversation was a quite a timely one. And I've been thinking about this a lot as we had this

(0:31) conversation about how to kind of frame it. And I think back to Ben, you and I

(0:36) did a couple of meetups out in BC and the reaction was

(0:41) very much appreciated, but it was a little surprisingly over the top. But I think that's a reflection and and you

(0:47) and I talked about it afterwards. It's a reflection that kind of what we stand for in Canada really sticks out like a

(0:52) sore thumb. And today's conversation with Professor John Y. Campbell and and

(0:58) his new book really kind of tied it all together for me. It's just so

(1:04) fascinating how the timing of all this came together and what we're living especially in Canada. and he talks about

(1:10) the Canadian experience and it comes down to the line I wrote down is capitalism is broken in finance in

(1:17) Canada where you've got a a financial system that is so

(1:24) complicated for the average person that has come down to brands and it doesn't come down to the the decision of where

(1:29) to go doesn't come down to quality or price it's about brands and you and I have talked about that a lot and I I

(1:37) just think that John is such a great researcher and communicator and he's so passionate about this about making a

(1:43) difference and and it's nice because he doesn't simply kind of throw arrows at the issue. He actually comes up with

(1:50) some policy suggestions for change for making it better. This conversation was was

(1:57) incredible. Yeah. And so that is I just want to say

(2:02) real quick when when you said the reaction of people at the meetups was over the top. You mean that it was like people were so unbelievably appreciative

(2:09) to the point where you and I couldn't believe that they were so appreciative. And that was because we had taken this

(2:16) complex confusing financial world and given people you know relatively straightforward actionable stuff that

(2:23) allowed them to feel much more confident and people are just so appreciative of that. That's what you're talking about. Yeah. And that's basically what John's

(2:30) book is aiming to do. uh he lays out uh a lot of the important financial

(2:36) decisions that people make throughout their lives, the mistakes that people make, the normative advice like what an

(2:43) economist, what he as an economist and his co-author would tell people they should do, uh and then how all of that

(2:50) interacts with the current financial system, which uh in a lot of ways, not

(2:56) just in Canada, but all all around the world is uh is not great. The interaction between individuals and uh

(3:04) financial companies, corporations, capitalists as John calls them in the book is often detrimental to

(3:12) individuals. Uh and that happens for a whole bunch of different reasons that we talk about in the episode. There's also

(3:17) a quote from the book that to me just captures the whole essence of the book. I read it during the conversation with

(3:23) John. uh just he he says something like he says basically that section of the

(3:28) book uh that that refers to that quote, but I was like I gotta read the quote because it's so good. Anyway, so I'm not

(3:33) going to read it again now, but you'll you'll hear it uh during the episode. Um but it's fascinating the way

(3:41) that they've been able to uh the framework they've been been able to put

(3:46) that interaction between the consumer and and capitalism. Uh and then like you

(3:52) said Cameron, not only why is this detrimental in a lot of cases, but how

(3:57) can we fix it? And so that's that's the premise of the book is his new new book uh is is called fixed uh why personal

(4:06) finance is broken and how to make it work for everyone co-authored with uh Terrun Ramadori.

(4:12) That's a comes out two days we understood from talking to John uh two days before this episode is released.

(4:19) So, when you're hearing this that book, will it be available for sale from Princeton University Press? I read it to

(4:26) prepare for this conversation. Um, we got a pre-eread copy and I I thoroughly thoroughly enjoyed it because it takes

(4:34) so much of the literature in household finance, which is the study of how do people actually make decisions and how

(4:41) does that differ from what normative normative advice says. It takes so much of that literature and makes it uh

(4:48) digestible for somebody who doesn't necessarily who who doesn't need to read the paper. Um which I think is pretty

(4:54) cool. It takes all that research and makes it accessible which is obviously really important. Uh okay, so real

(5:02) quick, John Y. Campbell is the Mortyn Ellen Carroll S. Olan Professor of

(5:07) Economics at Harvard University. He's been there since 1994.

(5:12) uh I mean but he doesn't really need an introduction honestly but he's he's published over a hundred articles uh on

(5:17) various aspect as aspects of finance and macroeconomics uh he's written several books including

(5:23) some uh very popular textbooks uh which we read to prepare for our conversation

(5:28) with him last time which was lots of fun uh yeah like I said I mean he's a he's

(5:34) one of the most well-known uh financial economists in the world today so I don't

(5:39) know how much more introduction he needs If if you want to listen to the other episode, it's episode 250 was the last

(5:46) time that John joined us. Yeah. So, this is a wide-ranging episode. We talk about

(5:51) really the the book and and therefore this conversation really try to cover uh a broad cross-section of household

(5:58) finance, of personal finance to use the more colloquial as opposed to academic term. Uh so, it's like the broad broad

(6:06) overview. What decisions are people making? What mistakes are people making? How is the financial system interacting

(6:12) with that? And what can we do to make it better? There you go. Did it go?

(6:19) All right, let's go to our episode with John Y. Campbell.

(6:24) John Campbell, welcome back to the Rational Reminder podcast. Thank you. It's a pleasure to be with

(6:30) you. It's a pleasure to be talking to you again and uh I I thoroughly enjoyed your

(6:35) new book, which is primarily what we're going to be talking about today. You guys did a a really nice job.

(6:40) Thank you. All right. So to start us off, can you explain to us what is the role of the

(6:46) financial system from the perspective of an ordinary person?

() 

(6:52) Well, ordinary people use finance in many different ways. Um I mean a first

(6:58) one is just to smooth out the ups and downs in income. People have a lot of volatility in their lives and many

(7:05) people have quite unstable income and and and also emergency spending needs

(7:11) that that pop up and you need to have resources to to handle that. You hopefully have some savings. If not, you

(7:18) may need to borrow. Um, a second purpose is to move resources from the middle of

(7:25) your life where most most of us, you know, in middle age have more income relative to our spending needs. And we

(7:32) need to move that income to where we need it in life. We need to move it early in life to help fund some of the

(7:39) large investments we have to make early on, pay for higher education, buy a house, and then we need to move those

(7:46) resources late in life in order to live uh comfortably after we retire. Um the

(7:52) financial system also enables us to make small investments in risky productive projects. you know very few of us can um

(8:01) you know buy a container ship or a factory but we can buy small shares of things. Um and then uh the financial

(8:08) system helps us manage risks. We have to ensure against you know natural disasters against uh

(8:15) health problems uh against early death that might take us away from our families and leave them in need. So

(8:23) these are all vitally important functions of the financial system that we all use in our lives.

(8:30) And how do you describe the main problems with the financial system in its current state?

() 

(8:36) Well, basically I would say that financial products are too complicated and too expensive. Um so you know

(8:44) complicated um you know they're just they're just hard to manage. um

(8:49) confusing to shop for. People are people get very reluctant to shop for financial

(8:55) products um because they feel they don't really understand them. They're hard to compare. Um and you know, after you buy

(9:03) them, they're very often hard to manage. You have to make decisions. You have to know to avoid hidden fees, things like

(9:10) overdraft charges, late fees on credit cards. um you need to know when to take certain

(9:17) actions like refinancing a mortgage uh at a good time. This is just hard stuff.

(9:23) Um and then you know because these financial products are complicated uh

(9:29) and we don't like to shop for them that enables financial product providers and

(9:35) service providers to really re to to to really compete more

(9:40) on branding and less on price and quality. So, it's all too common to just

(9:47) go to your just go to your bank that you know and regularly use and take whatever

(9:52) product they offer you. Um, I know for example in in Canada that that's very

(9:58) common when when choosing a mortgage. Um, but really if people shopped around

(10:03) more they'd be able to get better prices. So, you know, we we are we think

(10:09) uh too complicated and too expensive are the are are the big are the big problems. And

(10:17) finally, I would say expensive particularly for people who have less

(10:22) education and less financial sophistication, less experience. I mean, if you're a savvy person working in the

(10:30) financial industry or, you know, you're a finance professor, uh maybe you do pretty well. Um, but there are a lot of

(10:37) other people who don't. And one of the things we highlight in the book and we're very concerned about is the

(10:43) unequal impact of these problems on our population.

(10:49) Yeah, there's there's a ton of depth to the all of the stuff that you just said. It's like uh you say it so fluidly, but

(10:57) I'm thinking about all all of the the research that backs it up. like the just the the difficulty in comparing uh the

(11:03) cost of financial products even is is uh such an interesting topic. C can you can you talk about what makes financial

(11:10) decisions so difficult for people to process? Well, I think um the truth is that the

(11:17) human mind didn't really evolve to solve financial problems. Uh we have to we

(11:23) have to learn that um it's inherently mathematical. You have to be willing to

(11:29) do some calculations and think numerically and that is not intuitive for many

(11:35) people and it needs a lot of education uh which is sadly in many ways uh

(11:41) lacking. Um when we make intuitive decisions we often are we often use

(11:48) certain rules of thumb that can lead us astray. So um one example would be

(11:55) thinking in the wrong units. So just for example um suppose you think you you you you

(12:03) want to be a good shopper so you have a keen eye for discounts. It's natural to think about the percentage discount

(12:11) but you know a 20% off on a bottle of shampoo is very different than 20% off

(12:16) on a car or a a uh an insurance policy.

(12:21) And often people devote too much effort to chasing small discounts on small

(12:27) ticket items and don't think enough about the large ticket items where a smaller percentage discount would would

(12:35) really be worth more in dollar terms. So so you know the question of what units to think in um is something that really

(12:42) confuses people. I would also like to say that uh you know beyond the cognitive issues there's just the

(12:50) difficulty of struggling with temptation. Um and you know this is something that human beings have dealt

(12:57) with for the whole existence of our species right and there are old-fashioned ways of talking about you

(13:03) know temptation and and so forth. Um the modern economics language about this is

(13:09) called present bias which means valuing the the good stuff in the present um and

(13:17) really valuing it too much relative to the future. Um and conversely putting

(13:22) off anything that's uh you know painful and unpleasant. Um so you know why don't

(13:28) people save? Why don't they accumulate an emergency fund? Well, you know, that falls that flies in the face of the

(13:36) temptation to meet the needs of the present moment. Uh why don't people

(13:42) shop around for financial products and get the best price? Well, it's unpleasant and maybe you think you're

(13:48) going to get to it next week and then you never do. Um so that's another

(13:53) aspect of the problem. You mentioned education, John. How effective is financial literacy

(13:59) education of actually improving financial behaviors? So, I'd like to say that I'm, you know,

() 

(14:06) very committed to financial education. I think it's very important. Uh, and I'm in the business because I, you know, in

(14:13) in in college at Harvard, I teach a uh personal finance course that has no

(14:19) prerequisites and and this year I have almost 350 students taking the course. I'm very glad about that. And I think

(14:27) what I can teach them is both useful and you know intellectually valuable as an

(14:32) introduction to economics. Um having said that we must always remember that if that that college education college

(14:39) financial literacy education is just going to help people who in any case are going to end up towards the top of the

(14:46) income distribution the top let's say onethird of the population. So, we can't really solve the inequality problem with

(14:53) with college financial education, no matter how effective it is. Um, of

(14:58) course, there's a movement to offer financial education in secondary school, in high school in particular. And I'm

(15:05) also very committed to that. Um, I'm on the board of a nonprofit called the Council for Economic Education, which

(15:12) does great work promoting both economics and personal finance education in high

(15:18) schools. And you know many US states now now require this as part of the the

(15:23) curriculum and I think that's a good thing to do but I think we should have realistic expectations about what can be

(15:30) achieved with this. Um the you know there's a number of problems. One is

(15:35) that to teach personal finance well you need to have good math intuition and

(15:42) that's the scarcest resource among high school teachers. you know, those people are math teachers very often and and

(15:48) they're they're very few and far between and very valuable. Um, a second issue is

(15:54) that um, high school students are not yet

(15:59) making many of the big decisions that they have to make. Yes, maybe they might have a first credit card, maybe they

(16:06) might be taking out some student debt. So, the first few decisions are coming along, but many things are are further

(16:12) away in life. And I like to make the analogy with driver's ed. Can you imagine ho how effective would driver's

(16:20) ed be if you didn't get if the students never got behind the wheel but just sat in the classroom and heard about the

(16:27) rules of the road? Well, I don't think they would remember very much. And and that's the the same problem uh that we

(16:34) have with with finance education. Uh finally, of course, uh there's all this

(16:39) financial innovation. The products are always changing. The terminology changes. there are new tricks and traps.

(16:46) So, uh you have to continually refresh the education to keep up with this. So,

(16:52) I think it's very worth trying, very worth doing, but it's not a complete solution in itself.

(16:59) Yeah. And learning is hard like for a a person to want to learn part of it being

(17:04) able to do it like the driving example, but it's just like learning is hard period. Yeah. Um,

(17:10) so we think, look, we think there's a role to try to make things easier and and, you know, diminish the gap between

(17:17) where people are at and what they need to know. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, okay. This question is

(17:25) probably my my favorite question related to the book and I sent you a quote from the book when I sent you these questions

(17:31) ahead of time because and I think it's just the most uh overall powerful concept. Can you explain how

(17:38) capitalists, business people, financial companies, whatever, respond to investors or or individuals who

(17:44) misperceive the benefits and costs of financial products.

() 

(17:50) Yes. Uh um this is indeed the the heart of the book and we have a chapter called the corruption of capitalism where we

(17:55) talk about this. So you know what's the idea of capitalism? It's that um competitive profit-seeking business

(18:01) people will compete to meet the needs of customers at the lowest possible price

(18:08) and the best possible quality. And you know I would argue that there's a lot of evidence that that basic um insight is

(18:16) correct and that capitalism can be very effective. However, it depends critically on people knowing what they

(18:23) want and need and being willing to, you know, to to shop on the basis of quality

(18:29) and price. And the difficulty in this context is that investors are confused.

(18:35) They they don't really understand the benefits of financial products. They're easily distracted by sort of shiny

(18:41) features like um you know um let's say a

(18:47) flaw on an investment return. Oh, you can never lose money. Something like that. That'll that'll attract a lot of

(18:52) attention and they'll miss um other disadvantages of the same product.

(18:58) People also uh fail to see all the costs associated with a product. Um, so you

(19:05) know, you might focus on an initial APR on a credit card and not realize that the rate's going to reset after a year

(19:12) or that, you know, it'll reset if you uh make one late payment, these kinds of

(19:18) things. So, there are hidden costs, hidden benefits. Well, what happens? um you know capitalists respond to the

(19:24) needs that people think they have the demands that they are expressing in the marketplace not the not the the the

(19:32) demands that they should have if they were really acting in their own self-interest. So of course the system

(19:37) the same competitive capitalist system delivers uh the wrong products with um you know

(19:45) overappreciated benefits and hidden costs and that we have many many examples of that in the book. But then

(19:53) there's more to it than that because um since people kind of know how difficult

(19:58) this is, they are reluctant to shop as I mentioned and that means that

(20:03) um financial firms often have market power in the retail space. They can mark

(20:08) up their products and they can compete on the basis of brand. Um, you know, one

(20:14) one example, um, is that I live in a suburb of Boston, Lexington, that has a

(20:21) high a high street, a main street with many many bank branches. And they're

(20:27) they're all empty basically except for an ATM and somebody sitting there twiddling their thumbs. And why does

(20:33) this happen? Well, the banks are competing to make people believe that,

(20:38) you know, there's a physical branch. It's a safe place to put my money. it's branding. Um, and of course, this is a

(20:47) wasteful form of competition that really really doesn't add value. And um, you

(20:53) know, a lot of the profits that that could be made are actually dissipated in this in this type of uh branding

(21:00) competition for for naive customers who don't know that they should shop on the basis of price and quality. And then

(21:08) finally, there are all the mistakes that people make. uh when they manage their

(21:13) products. So, a big example that I like to talk about is mortgage refinancing.

(21:18) Uh particularly in the US with our long-term fixed rate mortgages, but also in other systems, mortgages reward

(21:27) um keeping an eye on interest rates and refinancing at an advantageous moment. And you have the right to do that and

(21:32) you can lower your rate by doing that. Um in the UK where they have adjustable

(21:39) rate mortgages, this plays out with teaser rates. You get an a low rate early on and then it resets to a high

(21:44) rate and you want to jump from one teaser rate to the next. Well, many people don't do that and particularly

(21:51) less educated and poorer people don't do that. They then provide extra revenue to

(21:57) the mortgage lenders which in turn the mortgage lenders are competing for business and part of what they do is

(22:03) they lower mortgage rates upfront for everyone. Well, that's great if you know how to refinance. I have a lower mortgage rate

(22:11) than I would have in a world where everybody refinanced promptly.

(22:16) But my cheap mortgage is in part being subsidized by the mistakes of others.

(22:21) It's a reverse Robin Hood transfer from the poor to the rich. And once you see

(22:27) that, you see it everywhere. It's there in credit card rewards. It's there in cheap checking accounts. Um it's there

(22:35) in insurance uh life insurance premium. Um it's it's it's a big problem and um

(22:44) it's it's it's a we call it cross subsidy. Um there's academic work on

(22:49) this which uses the term shrouded equilibrium um done by my colleagues

(22:56) Zavier Gex and David Leonson. So you know this is a a a very troubling um

(23:05) perversion or corruption of of capitalism. Yeah, the shroud shrouding is crazy.

(23:12) That's uh I think we see that so much in financial products like you you mentioned the floor on an investment

(23:17) referencing a structured product and it's like those are so complex it takes a a PhD literally to figure out what

(23:24) should this thing cost and a random people a person walking into a bank being like look what you could earn on

(23:30) this thing and you won't lose money. There's no way they're going to be able to evaluate that, right? and and even you know um

(23:36) structured products we know are a little bit complicated but just even plain vanilla mortgages that everybody has

(23:43) that the the optimal refinancing problem that's a real options problem that's

(23:48) that's not even in textbooks and um of course people refinance with a

(23:54) certain amount of randomness sometimes they do more of it sometimes less um in a way that's very unpredictable

(24:02) that's that generates the phenomenon of prepayment risk in in in mortgages which

(24:09) in turn you know the the the industry hires uh very sophisticated researchers

(24:16) PhDs to model prepayment risk. So the irony is that we have this hard to

(24:23) hedge, hard to model, hard to understand form of risk in in in financial markets

(24:29) which arises from the fact that we've given ordinary people a product that they don't know how to manage.

(24:36) Yeah, it's crazy. Uh I want I want to read the quote real quick that I that I sent you by email. Uh you said mo most

(24:44) of this, but it's the the way that it's written is just so elegant. Um, capitalists respond to the actual demand

(24:50) for their products, not the demands that would exist if people were perfectly rational and truly understood their own

(24:55) best interests. Since people's demands are driven by the benefits they perceive rather than the benefits they actually

(25:01) get, the financial system supplies too many products with exaggerated benefits and too few products with

(25:06) underappreciated benefits. And since perceived costs rather than actual costs drive people's demands, the financial

(25:12) system supplies too many products with hidden costs. It's just like, man, it's just so good.

(25:19) Oh, thank you. Thanks. Yeah. So, what effect does competition have on

(25:24) the pricing of financial products? So, we think that critically depends on

(25:30) how ordinary people are shopping, right? If they if we if we can simplify the

(25:36) products so that they shop on the basis of price and quality, then competition is going to deliver low price and high

(25:42) quality. Um if on the other hand people are shopping on the basis of of familiarity, big brand names and so on

(25:50) then what competition will deliver is a lot of uh advertising and other forms of expense like opening up empty bank

(25:56) branches. Uh you know that will help um the financial firms hang on to their

(26:02) customers but won't actually improve uh price or quality.

(26:08) So we we we think competition can be good. Um, but there are some preconditions for it to deliver on its

(26:15) promise. [Music] There's uh there's been this big push in

(26:20) Canada recently for uh exchange traded funds that use covered calls. So, so

(26:26) writing call call options on equities that the fund owns and then levering that back up to a higher expected

(26:32) return, which to me I I think these products are kind of crazy. I I've made a couple videos about them recently. Yeah. Um but but they are kind of innovative

(26:39) like put that putting that in ETF rapper. It's like, hey, that's that's pretty cool, even if I don't think it's a good idea. C can you talk about

(26:45) generally speaking who innovation in retail financial products benefits?

() 

(26:51) Well, you know, I I would say it's a mixed picture. Some innovation that's driven by technology um really has

(26:59) lowered costs for small savers and small investors. You know, fundamentally, it

(27:04) lowers fixed costs. Um you know, you don't need to hire somebody writing in a

(27:09) big paper book. you know to keep track of accounts. Uh you have software to do that, right? So um all kinds of things

(27:17) can be done on a small scale whether that's um you know just plain vanilla banking or whether it's you know it can

(27:23) be credit extension, it can be uh equity trading. Um lots of things are very

(27:30) cheap. Um you know stock trading is much cheaper than it used to be for small investors. Um

(27:37) uh it's also possible to customize um and you know think about robo advising

(27:42) which it offers customized financial advice at low cost. So you know there

(27:48) are definitely innovations that are very beneficial. Um there was this famous remark that Paul Fulka the former

(27:55) chairman of the Fed made at one point where he said you know I the the the only kind of financial innovation that I

(28:02) think was worthwhile was the ATM. Um, well, I would I I disagree with that. I

(28:07) think there's a lot else that's gone on. But having said that, there's also innovation that is designed to come up

(28:15) with a new complication and confuse people uh and create demand through

(28:21) confusion. Um, and you know, structured products since

(28:27) since you brought them up, you know, why do they why do they appeal? Why would an ordinary person want to have a put

(28:33) option? Um, you know, a nonlinear payoff structure to use the technical term. Um,

(28:40) well, one reason I think is that people are are not thinking about interest and

(28:47) the interest they're giving up. So if they're told you cannot lose money

(28:53) that in other words your return can never be negative in nominal terms they

(28:59) forget about the fact that they should be earning interest and if they had a safe investment they would earn

(29:04) interest. Um so it sounds like a cannot lose deal but of course you can lose and

(29:10) you are in fact losing the interest rate. That loss of the interest rate then is what gives the structured

(29:17) product issuer the resources to both put in some shiny features that

(29:23) attract the customers but also then take a very handsome profit for themselves.

(29:30) So John, what makes conflicts of interest in retail finance such a big problem for consumers?

() 

(29:36) Well, I think um the problem really is that consumers are often very naive

(29:42) about the financial interests of the people they're dealing with in the financial system. Um now, you know, the

(29:49) the the financial system is bound to have counterparties and um you know in

(29:55) any commercial transaction the seller and the buyer have different interests. But unfortunately, um, while while

(30:03) people understand that when the job title of the person they're talking to is salesman, you know, and they sort of

(30:09) probably know to be wary of car salesman, they're often very naive about

(30:14) the people who work in banks, brokerage firms, mutual fund companies, and so on.

(30:21) And they ignore the fact that those people have their own interests. Um, and

(30:26) there's, you know, there's survey evidence that that people really just don't quite get that very often the

(30:32) person on the other side has their own motivation to sell a product that maybe has a high commission or at any rate

(30:38) generates high fees for the company they work for. Uh, and so they're not wary enough. Um, the problem of course is

(30:46) even more severe if we're talking about financial advice. And um

(30:52) you know it's important for people to find financial advisers that they can trust who are going to act in their

(30:57) interest the customer's interest not the adviser's own interest. There is of course um a good amount of regulation

(31:04) enforcing fiduciary duty the the legal duty to act in the customer's interest

(31:10) uh on the financial ind advice industry. Uh but unfortunately when you look at

(31:15) the the you know the records of enforcement there's also a lot of evidence that uh financial advisers um

(31:23) don't always live up to that and uh particularly when they have um older and

(31:29) less sophisticated customers who may who may be naive who may be easy to uh to exploit. Uh so this is another serious

(31:37) type of problem that that we face in in in finance.

(31:42) Yeah. Yeah, there was just a report uh done by the regulator, two of the securities regulators in Canada where

(31:49) they looked at the conflicts of interest and sales practices at Canada's big bank mutual fund dealerships.

(31:55) And I mean, kind of like what you just said, it painted a pretty bleak picture of what people are actually getting when

(32:00) they go in looking for advice. Uh

(32:05) and one, let me just make one more point. What many people feel instinctively that if they've been a

(32:12) longtime customer of a a bank or a big financial institution, then they must be

(32:17) a very valued customer who will be well treated. And actually, it's the opposite. Somebody who's been a customer

(32:24) for a long time, the the bank will tend to assume that they're not shopping

(32:29) around. They're not very alert. And very often they could be offered, you know, a higher price than somebody might be

(32:35) offered if they who walks in off the street or who is visibly shopping around.

(32:41) That's so interesting you say that. I I spoke at an event for uh seniors day in Canada uh I think last week

(32:48) and that was the sentiment in the audience uh where they were like because we one of the topics we talked about was

(32:54) this these conflicts of interest at the bank and several people said I feel like like exactly what you just said I feel like I

(33:00) should be getting treated really well because I've been a customer here for 50 years but as you say it's often the the

(33:05) exact opposite. Yeah it is wild. Uh, so kind of related

(33:11) to that, what are the downsides of just avoiding the financial system? Someone hears everything we've said so far and

(33:16) they're like, I don't want anything to do with that. I'm just going to store cash under my mattress or buy gold or buy Bitcoin or something like that.

() 

(33:23) Yeah. Unfortunately, that's a very common reaction and we talk about it in the book and we say basically people are

(33:29) jumping uh out of the frying pan into the fire. So, um, yeah, you can you can,

(33:34) you know, keep keep cash quote under your mattress. uh you won't earn any interest. Um

(33:40) uh and you know that's that that's a big problem particularly in an inflationary environment. Um many people also turn to

(33:49) informal sources of credit you know borrowing and lending from friends and family. Um but you know that can also be

(33:57) problematic um because um

(34:03) on the one hand it can be hard to to to get your money back. Um

(34:08) and um on the other hand uh the social sanctions for default if indeed somebody

(34:14) does enter financial distress can be extremely painful and and unpleasant. Um

(34:20) so other people turn to you know informal you know money lenders, lone sharks and

(34:26) so on. um that's not so much a problem in you know Canada or or or the US but but in many parts of the world uh you

(34:33) know there's uh uh there are criminals who will lend you money but um you know

(34:39) they have their own ways of getting repaid and it's it's a very dangerous uh a very dangerous path

(34:46) um and then finally crypto you know crypto appeals particularly to people who distrust the financial system uh in

(34:54) the US actually African-Americans are disproport proportionately interested in crypto because of their painful history

(35:00) of being mistreated by big white-owned businesses and so crypto seems like an alternative. But um you know first of

(35:09) all uh crypto investments are very speculative. Uh yes, crypto prices have gone up a lot recently, but it's it's a

(35:16) it's a a wild ride and a lot of the parallel financial institutions that

(35:22) exist in the crypto space, crypto exchanges and so forth are completely unregulated, very vulnerable to frauds

(35:30) and scams, runs, panics, collapse. Uh there are endless horror stories. So you

(35:36) know we think people who opt out of formal finance are jumping out of the frying pan into the

(35:41) fire and furthermore uh society needs the formal financial system because this

(35:47) is what you know funds productive investments and the modern economy depends on having a well functioning

(35:53) financial system. So if people opt out or if or if just politically finance becomes very unpopular

(36:00) then it's you know easy for populist politicians to rail against finance and

(36:07) um you know perhaps it'll lead to uh policies that will be economically

(36:12) destructive. So we're interested in you know reforming finance in order to to

(36:18) save it um rather than replacing the system in any in any sense.

(36:24) Yeah, that seems uh a lot more sensible than when crypto, especially when it was uh really gaining steam. A lot of the

(36:31) narrative was like, you know, we're going to burn down the existing financial system or it's going to collapse anyway and we're going to

(36:36) replace it with crypto. But I think that fixing what we have probably makes a lot more sense.

(36:43) Uh you mentioned consumption smoothing, although you explained it in a less academic way earlier when we were

(36:49) talking about just how how people interact with the financial system. Can you talk about how important it is for people to have access to emergency

(36:56) savings or credit just to fund lumpy consumption?

(37:02) Yes. Um you know the the it it's extremely important uh because

(37:10) why? Because um many many people have very volatile income. Um there are

(37:16) people who you know own small businesses. It's a wild ride. There are people who work for seasonal businesses

(37:23) or small businesses or who have part-time employment. Um, you know, when

(37:29) you study the income profile of workingclass people, uh, certainly in

(37:34) America, but similar patterns elsewhere, when you look at the month-to-month volatility, it's very extreme. You

(37:41) wouldn't necessarily see it if you just looked at their tax returns every year, but it's month by month. And then there

(37:47) are similar spikes in spending. So, you know, your car breaks down or your pipes

(37:53) burst, uh or maybe um you know, your your daughter gets married. Um you know,

(37:59) important spending needs come up and you need to be able to fund those. Yet at

(38:05) the same time uh there are very few people relatively few people who can

(38:10) actually finance you know three months of of consumption of their normal consumption spending which is a a sort

(38:17) of standard benchmark of of having an adequate emergency fund. I I would say you should have more than three months

(38:22) but let's take three months as the benchmark. In the US, um, you know, 40%

(38:28) of people are financially vulnerable, meaning they they they can't do that. They don't have the three months. Um, in

(38:34) the UK, it's about 50%. Uh, in a country like South Africa, it's uh 90%.

(38:42) Um, I'm mentioning these other countries, let me say, because our book has a global perspective. We're not just

(38:48) writing about the US or a few developed countries like the US, Canada, the UK.

(38:53) we're really trying to talk about the whole world. Um, and of course, if you don't have the

(38:58) emergency savings and you do need money, then you're going to have to borrow at short notice. And that tends to be very

(39:04) expensive. You know, whether it's uh whether it's borrowing on a credit

(39:09) card, um maybe not even making your minimum payment, so you have to get a late fee. uh or whether it's

(39:19) taking out a payday loan which often has uh an APR of something like 500%.

(39:25) Um you know short-term unsecured credit arranged at short notice is really really expensive.

(39:34) How should someone decide whether to go to college?

() 

(39:39) That's a great question and one that we talk about in the book. We talk about funding big investments by which we mean

(39:45) basically college and houses although you could also talk about cars. Um

(39:51) so college we argue is an investment that actually has uh a very high return

(39:56) for most of the people who go to college. That doesn't mean it would have a high return for everybody else. you

(40:02) know, you have to have um the you know, the you have to have the the the the

(40:09) cognitive skills and the and the desire to study something in college. It's not going to be for everybody, but for the

(40:16) people who go and we argue for quite a few other people as well actually um the

(40:21) the real rate of return is very high. You you measure that by looking at the income gain uh for college graduates

(40:29) over high school graduates. Um and then you adjust for the cost of college because it's an investment that you have

(40:35) to to fund. Um but uh you know the the if you if you

(40:42) calculate college as an IRRa and look out uh say 20 years um you know you get

(40:49) you get real rates of return that are often between five and 10% which is you

(40:55) know considerably more than the real interest rate that people will will have to borrow at. Um, now it's particularly

(41:02) helpful to keep down the cost. So, if you're in the US, you know, going to a public university in the state where you

(41:07) live is often the most uh economical thing. Um, for many people, it may also

(41:15) make sense to start with a two-year college, a community college, go to that at a reduced rate, and then transfer to

(41:21) a four-year college. So, there are ways to cut keep down the cost. Uh but we argue um you know college is a good

(41:29) financial investment. You you do also need to think about what it is you're studying and what the rate of return is

(41:35) by the field of study. And you know generally STEM fields have had higher returns as well as uh fields that have

(41:45) you know stable and growing employment like uh like nursing as an example.

(41:52) I have uh I have a couple of follow-up questions. Um

(41:58) on on the rate of return from going to college, it can some of that be explained by selection bias like people

(42:04) who would have made more money anyway end up going to college? Certainly selection is important. Um and

(42:11) you know particularly at elite colleges I would I would not claim that the high incomes of my former students have much

(42:17) to do with my teaching. you know, I think I teach them well, but these are people who would who would succeed uh

(42:25) you know, almost regardless. Um, however, I think when you look at the the uh university system as a whole, um

(42:33) the the best research suggests that selection is not the main force that actually there is genuine uh value

(42:40) added. Okay, that's very interesting. Uh, and my other followup question is on on the

(42:45) programs that tend to have higher rates of return like STEM and and and nursing you mentioned, how how persistent should

(42:52) people expect things like that to be over time? Like I think a lot of people over the last 10 or 15 years looked at software engineering and said, "Yep, I'm

(42:59) going to make a lot of money." And right now it's maybe not as obvious that that's true. Absolutely. That's uh that's certainly

() 

(43:05) true. And that's um you know a good argument for the traditional vision of

(43:11) college education as training your mind to keep up with a very rapidly changing

(43:17) world and figure out whatever you need to figure out to to move forward. Um so I think it argues

(43:24) for for not being too narrowly v vocational in your vision of of of

(43:29) higher education. But I would also say that the I think the people who are

(43:34) going to thrive the most even in the world of AI and other advances I think are going to be people who can combine

(43:41) analytical skills with softer human skills uh communication understanding

(43:47) other people being able to work in teams and so forth. Uh I think that's the sweet spot is to

(43:52) is to have that combination of of skills.

(43:59) How should people decide whether to buy a home?

(44:05) So many people um I would say approach this the wrong way. Um in countries

(44:11) where house price and regions where house prices have been going up. A common thing that people say is house

(44:18) prices always go up. You've got to get on the housing ladder. Buy the biggest house you can afford as soon as you can

(44:24) scrape together and borrow the money. uh you know it's it's your ticket to to the

(44:30) middle class. Um and I think that is wrong. Um

(44:36) I think the the the the problem is that actually house prices are very hard to

(44:42) predict and just because they have been going up doesn't mean they will continue to go up. So you shouldn't chase

(44:48) performance in housing just as you shouldn't chase performance in the stock market or other risky asset markets.

(44:55) What I think, you know, is important to consider is first of all the the

(45:01) preferences you have about the type of housing you want. You know, younger adults who love living in cities in

(45:07) dense urban areas may very well want to rent an apartment. On the other hand, if you've started a family and you want

(45:13) good schools for your kids, you want to live in a suburb, very often most of the housing is owner occupied housing and

(45:20) you will want to buy a house for that reason. That's not a financial reason exactly. It's a lifestyle point. Uh but

(45:27) then beyond that, you you don't want to buy a house if you're very likely to move because buying and selling houses

(45:34) is extremely expensive. Uh you know, realtor commissions and other costs and

(45:39) fees, you know, can easily uh amount to several percentage points of the full

(45:45) value of the house. That's a lot of money. So unless you think you can stay put for at least 3 years and I would say

(45:54) better five years or more, you shouldn't you shouldn't buy. You should try to rent. And then finally, of course, you

(45:59) need to be sure you have a stable enough income to support the house to support the mortgage that you're likely going to

(46:05) have to take out because if you get if you get into a period of low income and

(46:11) you can't make your mortgage payments, you'll be foreclosed upon and you'll lose the house. And that does terrible

(46:18) damage both because it destroys value in the house. So it's going to take away

(46:23) your down payment in all probability and it's also going to damage your credit score um and leave you in a very bad

(46:30) position. So those kinds of considerations I think

(46:35) are the ones that uh most people should use not uh you know trying to predict

(46:40) what house prices will do. Completely agree. Uh we we talk about

(46:46) this a lot on our podcast. That's why Cameron's laughing. I mean, we say pretty much what you just said uh in many different ways. C

(46:53) can you talk about though how how the rent versus own decision for housing changes in retirement or does it change?

(47:01) Well, in retirement, um what people are often doing is trying to free up

(47:06) resources to live on. So, you know, hopefully you've got your retirement savings and you you draw upon that. uh

(47:13) many people will also have some component of defined benefit pension income, social security in the US and so

(47:19) on. Um but you know many people in retirement end up house rich and cash

(47:26) poor right if they bought a house earlier in their life they paid off the mortgage they've got all this housing

(47:32) equity and they may be short of other resources and then what you want to do

(47:38) is you want to liberate that housing equity so you can spend it and live on it. Now, an obvious way to do that is to

(47:44) downsize and, you know, move sell your big old house, family house, and move to

(47:50) an apartment or a condo in Florida or or a senior community perhaps. Um, but

(47:56) there are people who don't want to do that, and I can understand that. Um, in

(48:01) which case, uh, using mortgage finance actually is another way to go. um you

(48:07) can borrow against the value of your house and um you're going to want to use

(48:13) an interestonly mortgage or maybe even a reverse mortgage um in which you make no

(48:19) payments uh while you're living in retirement but but pay later when you either pass away or move the house is

(48:26) sold and then you pay off the mortgage at that time. And you know we argue that that's a very sensible structure. It's

(48:33) one that is not used enough we think in part because

(48:39) uh you know reverse mortgages um they're expensive to market. Seniors

(48:44) are distrustful and easily confused and they tend to to overvalue their homes.

(48:51) Many older people don't realize how much value is being destroyed by poor maintenance in their longtime homes. Um

(49:00) so for all those reasons, you know, uh reverse mortgages are hard to market. Um

(49:06) then there's the problem of market power and markups. Um so they have a bit of a bad reputation as an expensive product.

(49:12) Uh but we actually think it would be good if uh they could be more widely used and reasonably priced.

(49:20) What are the most common mortgage related mistakes that that you see households making?

() 

(49:27) The most basic one is failure to shop. Just taking the first mortgage quote you

(49:32) get. Incredible. And you know, there's evidence um this

(49:39) this like so many behaviors varies with what segment of the mortgage market you're looking at. If you're looking at

(49:45) in this country jumbo mortgages, which are the the big ones on expensive houses that you know higher income people might

(49:52) be taking out, uh the loss from not shopping around has been estimated at something like four basis points. So not

(49:59) too much. But if you look at um FHA mortgages which are disproportionately

(50:05) used by poorer people in the US uh who qualify for these government subsidized mortgages there the failure to shop is

(50:13) costing more like 28 basis points. So several times as much. Um and you might

(50:18) say oh 28 basis points how big a deal is that? But you got to remember the mortgage is a huge liability and a

(50:25) long-term liability. And you know, for a $200,000 mortgage, let's say, uh, you

(50:31) know, that turns out to be $600 or more a year, uh, for a long time. And so people leave

(50:39) money on the table by not shopping. Um, then and that's, um,

(50:46) then there's the failure to refinance. So, the type of refinancing you're going to want to do depends on the system

(50:52) you're in. Uh but in the US um when fix when mortgage when fixed mortgage rates

(50:58) fall you you do have an incentive to refinance. Um people often don't do it. And there's

(51:06) troubling evidence of racial discrepancies in this in this refinancing failure. So if you compare

(51:12) the mortgage rates that black and white borrowers pay at origination

(51:17) and you control for legitimate factors like credit score, there's almost no difference. So you know discrim racial

(51:25) discrimination in mortgage lending at the origination stage has been well regulated and controlled. But if you

(51:32) look at the rates people are actually paying on their outstanding mortgage and you look at a time when rates have

(51:37) fallen, you see a black white uh gap that can be as much as 50 basis points,

(51:44) half a percentage point. And why is that? It's because the black borrowers have not refinanced and they still have

(51:50) older high rate mortgages. Um, and whereas the white borrowers have refinanced. And so that's a troubling

(51:58) problem. It's made worse in the US system by this weird institution called points, mortgage points. So what are

(52:06) points? Well, you might need to borrow a little extra money to cover your closing costs.

(52:12) Now, normally you think, well, you'll add to your debt. The the the interest rate is the interest rate. You add to

(52:18) the debt. But points, you don't change the face value of the debt. You change the interest rate. You borrow you borrow

(52:24) a little more money in effect, but it doesn't add to the official debt. It simply changes the interest rate and

(52:30) raises that rate. Well, if you've borrowed using points, if you've borrowed your closing costs, you have an

(52:36) even stronger incentive to refinance because your rate is high. you should

(52:41) why pay it? You should refinance. Uh but uh people don't do it and uh again

(52:47) particularly the the less educated and poorer and racial minority borrowers

(52:52) don't don't refinance. So I would say points are a particularly confusing

(52:57) feature of the US mortgage system and lowhanging fruit for reg simple

(53:03) regulation to improve the system is simp simply ban points. If people need to borrow their closing costs, have them

(53:09) add it to the debt. You can relax the LTV constraint to to allow for borrowing

(53:16) closing costs, but do not change the rate because that just confuses everyone. And it's it's certainly not

(53:22) textbook finance. I mean, it's it's um it takes quite a bit of work to figure

(53:28) that out. Yeah, it's really interesting. Uh no no no pun intended there. Do we know why

(53:35) there's that racial disparity? Um, well, it it's it's a little hard to

(53:42) disentangle. Some of this is certainly that black borrowers may have more unstable incomes. So, they may no longer

(53:50) qualify uh for the same mortgage rate that they were originally able to get. So, so there are those problems, but we

(53:58) know that it's just systematically true wherever you look that people with less

(54:04) um education and lower income, less financial sophistication, if you like,

(54:10) are slower to do these things. I mean, I have a a study um with Terrun and and

(54:17) other co-authors where we look at the Danish mortgage system where you have an absolute right to refinance. Doesn't

(54:23) matter what your income is, what your house price is. If you want to lower your rate, you can always do that. And

(54:29) even there, we find the same patterns that um older people, less educated

(54:34) people, lower income people are slower to refinance and they leave money on the table.

(54:40) Wow. Uh okay, moving on to a different topic here. One of the things we spent a lot

(54:47) of time talking to you about last time uh you were on our podcast was utility theory. Can you talk about how utility

(54:54) as a concept informs sensible risk-taking? Okay. So uh that's another great

() 

(55:00) question and we we actually we we have a chapter on on um on risk uh uh you know

(55:08) living with risk um and I guess fools rush in where angels fear

(55:14) to tread. We try to use utility theory, this very academic concept um as a practical guide to to both taking risk

(55:22) in investing and also how you should approach uh insurance. Um

(55:28) and we tried to explain how utility theory uh in its standard form

(55:35) Bob Mertton and things we talked about the last time I was on this podcast with

(55:40) you. how that standard utility theory leads to simple principles like yes, you

(55:46) should participate in risky markets. You should take some risk even if you're very cautious. Um

(55:53) uh and you can scale your risk by thinking about your risk aversion uh

(55:59) intelligently and uh and investing uh accordingly. Um, on the insurance side,

(56:07) we we use utility theory to explain why you should in the when insurance is

(56:13) marked up, so it's not actuarially fair because it covers the costs of the

(56:18) insurance company, you shouldn't try to fully insure. You should accept deductibles and other things that limit

(56:25) your insurance. And essentially you should ensure the

(56:31) big risks and not sweat the small stuff. Utility theory is very clear about this.

(56:36) Do not do not bother to ensure small risks when there's markups on the insurance. Go for the big things. Make

(56:43) sure the catastrophes are covered and leave the small stuff alone. And we

(56:49) think that's really important advice because people so often do the opposite. they they buy extended warranties on

(56:55) washing machines. Um and then they don't buy catastrophe insurance or you know

(57:01) long-term care insurance which are really huge risks of life. Um so I don't

(57:08) know whether the chapter will will work whether it will be intelligible but we felt it was important to try to show how

(57:14) utility theory can provide a simple unified framework for making all these

(57:19) decisions that may seem very different but underneath the hood they're all they're all based on the same

(57:25) principles. [Music] So interesting. So what are the most important principles for successfully

() 

(57:32) investing in stocks? Well, and once you get past participate,

(57:37) which is, you know, just do it. Um, then you you you need to ask how to do it. Um, and so we talk about

(57:44) diversification. That's s super important. Um, you know, we we we show

(57:50) how diversification can reduce risk, leave the expected return very much the

(57:56) same. That means it increases the ratio of reward to risk or so-called sharp ratio. that means you should invest more

(58:03) aggressively for any level of risk aversion. So we we talk through that. Um

(58:09) then we talk about the importance of watching the fees and uh you know for many people they're not going to be

(58:14) necessarily investing directly. They're going to be buying mutual funds or other intermediated financial products which

(58:21) charge fees and you should be very mindful of those fees. um they may not be as salient as recent performance but

(58:28) they are they are for sure the recent performance may or may not repeat the

(58:34) fees almost certainly will. Um so we emphasize that and and and we try to

(58:41) give the basic intuition of market efficiency that returns are hard to predict. Um we say don't chase

(58:47) performance. um uh you know focus on long-term historical evidence about

(58:53) rates of return uh diversification, low fees. So it's very much the classic

(58:59) advice of the of finance professors. Um but we try to make it do make it

(59:04) readable and and accessible. Yeah. No, it's good. So participate in the equity markets, diversify, minimize

(59:11) fees, don't chase performance, right? Pretty pretty advice, I'd say.

(59:16) Yeah. Yeah. Uh so important question though empirically how does actual investor

(59:23) behavior compare to those principles? Uh well people ignore most of this

(59:29) advice uh or many people do. Um I mean we we we have problems on all fronts. um

(59:36) you know um uh participation is actually

(59:42) surprisingly low even even among people who have sub some sub substantial assets. Um we think one reason for that

(59:50) in the US context is that the tax favored retirement accounts uh 401ks and

(59:56) so forth that work so well for employees of big companies are much less um

(1:00:02) available to people who work for small companies or are self-employed or jump from one job to another. So there's a

(1:00:08) real access problem there for the the tax favored retirement investing. Uh

(1:00:13) that that's one reason. um and and we'd like to fix that. Um

(1:00:20) then of course um you know people um

(1:00:29) people are not as smart as they should be about fees. Now I I will say there's some there's some progress in the sense

(1:00:35) that the traditional um you know active retail mutual fund

(1:00:40) that charges a percentage points of AUM that you know their their assets have

(1:00:46) been diminishing and passive funds have been gaining share. Uh at the same time

(1:00:51) of course um high fee high octane uh active investments have been gaining

(1:00:57) share. um uh many of those are used by richer

(1:01:03) people um you know whether it's private equity funds uh alternatives hedge funds

(1:01:09) um but the latest trend now is active ETFs um and while they may be lower fee than

(1:01:17) some of the traditional active mutual funds uh they may simply be a a newer

(1:01:22) vehicle for separating people from their money. So, I'm I'm a little worried about what's going to happen with the

(1:01:28) rise of of uh active ETFs um for what

(1:01:33) I'll call uh naive investors. Um

(1:01:39) we know that performance chasing is still popular. Um and and sometimes it's encouraged by

(1:01:46) technology. Um, an example we give in the book is that in in China, the the

(1:01:51) smartphone app that many people use to shop for mutual funds, which is called Alipe,

(1:01:56) you bring up a screen on your phone and it sorts the funds by their performance

(1:02:01) in the last year. So the at the top of the screen is going to be whichever fund

(1:02:06) went up the most in the last year. That's typically going to be a very risky fund because if it weren't very

(1:02:12) risky, it wouldn't be it wouldn't have be at the top. Um, and so this is just in we all know how

(1:02:21) easy it is to click on the the thing that's at the top of the search list. Um, and and so this this encourages

(1:02:28) performance chasing. Um, and then finally, of course, actually we we we we

(1:02:33) should admit that people many people love to gamble. There is actually a demand for gambling. um whether that's

(1:02:42) casinos, whether it's sports betting, the latest is sports betting on the prediction markets, you know, Kelchi and

(1:02:48) so on. um crypto um there is a demand

(1:02:53) for that and I think we need to accept that some of that is is is human nature

(1:02:59) and I'm not trying to be a Puritan that shuts down every source of fund that people have but I do think it's

(1:03:05) important to distinguish gambling for fun from investing for your

(1:03:10) life and for your retirement and your your your lifetime risk management

(1:03:17) and I'm I'm worried that people are not not making that separation clear enough.

(1:03:23) Yeah, me too. What are the biggest insurance mistakes that people make?

() 

(1:03:29) Well, I've mentioned this um problem of um uh worrying too much about the small

(1:03:35) risks and not enough about the big ones. Um, one place where that pays plays out

(1:03:41) is in um choosing a health insurance plan in in in the US where it's a you

(1:03:47) know, it's a very complicated system. People have to make decisions. Um, you

(1:03:52) know, every year big employers will send out the new set of plans you can choose from and there'll be an open enrollment

(1:03:59) period. You have to make a choice. Actually, one thing I do in my class is I take the students through the health

(1:04:06) insurance choices that Harvard employees have to make and they get very confused

(1:04:11) and then I say, "You do realize that every employee of Harvard University, including the dining hall workers, have

(1:04:18) to make this, have to deal with this, you know, and that's sobering for them."

(1:04:23) Um, but in any event, the problem that people often make is that they they

(1:04:29) choose an expensive plan with a low deductible when they'd be much better off choosing a cheaper plan with a high

(1:04:35) deductible. And one rather shocking thing is that there's it's surprisingly

(1:04:40) common for employers to offer a menu of plans where some plans are actually dominated. By which I mean there is no

(1:04:47) scenario there is no level of health care costs in the coming year that would

(1:04:53) make the the the the plan cheaper than the other one. Um it's it's simply it's

(1:04:59) a simply a plan that you should not choose. Nobody should choose and in my view that's such a plan should not be

(1:05:05) offered. Um now I don't think the employers are doing this for malevolent reasons. They're not trying to trap

(1:05:12) their employees. It's just that first of all, the people who work in the benefits

(1:05:18) offices are often confused about this themselves. And secondly, they're catering to

(1:05:23) employees who love low deductibles, even though the insurance companies make those low deductibles very expensive.

(1:05:31) And rather than try to explain to employees why it's a ripoff, they just say, "All right, we'll we'll let this be

(1:05:38) offered." Well, then what happens? the the poorer employees um the lower paid

(1:05:43) people disproportionately choose these plans and the better off employees the

(1:05:49) faculty and administrators choose the the better deals and that's another distressing place

(1:05:56) where inequality is worsened by the menu of choices that people are offered.

(1:06:02) Yeah, it's crazy crazy stuff. But let me say it's not just the the the

(1:06:09) uh you know the people with the least education who are confused about this because I remember going to a Harvard

(1:06:14) faculty meeting years ago where Alan Garber who was then the provost and is now the president of Harvard was trying

(1:06:22) to explain the merits of high deductible cheap insurance policies. Now Alan Garber is one of the world's most

(1:06:28) distinguished health economists but he could not get through to the Harvard faculty and people were you know

(1:06:36) shouting at him that you're trying to take away our health insurance and oh my goodness you know it was really uh quite an

(1:06:43) eyeopening lesson for me to watch that. That is a great story. Yeah crazy.

(1:06:50) Uh okay switching gears again here. How much do people need to save for retirement?

(1:06:58) Well, you know, that's going to depend a lot on a number of of features. Um,

(1:07:05) you know, for one thing, it depends if you have access to some kind of defined benefit pension. Um,

(1:07:11) that's less and less common on the private side in this country, in the US. Um, public employees still often do have

(1:07:19) defined benefit pensions. Um uh it also depends on where you are in

(1:07:25) the income distribution because social security which is our universal government provided defined benefit

(1:07:30) pension it's progressive. So if you're a relatively poor person social security is going to replace a lot of your

(1:07:38) lifetime income. If you're a higher in the income distribution it's going to be very inadequate.

(1:07:44) So there's many special things you have to think about. But a rule, a rough rule of thumb that that I think is worth

(1:07:50) keeping in mind is you should aim to have about six years worth of your income saved up when you retire. And 15

(1:07:57) years before that, when you're say in 50 or in your early 50s, you should have

(1:08:02) four years worth saved by then. Um now the evidence is most people do

(1:08:09) not save that much. It's um you know even in a good year where the markets have been doing well and you know people

(1:08:17) have pretty good 401k balances a good year you might see four years of income

(1:08:23) saved at retirement on average instead of six. So not enough. Now some people

(1:08:29) have a lot of housing equity. You know you'll be you're likely to be okay if you actually have um uh a house with and

(1:08:38) you've paid off the mortgage. um that's going to make things much more comfortable. Um but anyway, sign significant saving

(1:08:45) would be the answer and more than most people are actually doing.

(1:08:51) And how should retirement savers allocate their investments?

() 

(1:08:57) I think I I um believe that uh you

(1:09:02) should think about um life cycle investing very much the way target date funds do. So, target date funds are a

(1:09:10) good innovation that has been spreading in in the last 20 years. And you know

(1:09:15) what they do is they have young people investing more aggressively than older people. Um, why is that? One reason

(1:09:22) might be that if you're investing for the long run, you can benefit from mean reversion in the stock market. That's

(1:09:28) something we talked about the last time I was talking with you on on rational reminder. But I think the bigger reason

(1:09:34) honestly is that young people have a lot of earning power in their they have an implicit asset which is their human

(1:09:40) capital or future earning power. And while that's risky of course you don't know how much you'll make it's much much

(1:09:47) safer than the stock market. So people young people have a relatively safe hidden asset and what they're doing over

(1:09:54) their working lives is gradually converting that hidden asset into explicit financial assets.

(1:10:01) So early in life, you should invest very aggressively because you're investing only a small portion of your total

(1:10:08) resources and then by the time you approach retirement, you're investing almost all your total resources and you

(1:10:14) should invest more conservatively. So target date funds do that, but

(1:10:20) there are some problems with the ones that exist. They they they often uh they don't um decline risk-taking

(1:10:26) aggressively enough. they they they start out a little too cautious and then they decline gradually.

(1:10:32) The the tilt should be should be steeper. Um target date funds should

(1:10:38) also um ideally should condition on how much

(1:10:43) you've saved already. It it's it's about the size of your financial assets

(1:10:48) relative to your earning power. So it's not shouldn't just depend on

(1:10:53) age. It should also depend on how much you've been saving and how well the market has done and so forth. Um, but

(1:11:00) that basic pattern is what I would uh recommend. And I think given the long

(1:11:06) life that that people should expect to have in retirement and the type of risk

(1:11:12) aversion that I think most people have, I think you should continue to take some equity risk even in retirement. Um,

(1:11:20) although you should start to think about annuitization. Uh and that's that's another you know important investment

(1:11:26) topic when you reach retirement. Yeah. That why we've we've tried talking

(1:11:32) to our clients about this and they don't tend to be very receptive. Why do you think annuities are not more popular?

(1:11:38) Like you just said as the as the classic finance professor, people should buy annuities and they don't. Why?

(1:11:46) Why? Um, I think uh people uh like to feel

(1:11:53) control and they they they like the sense that they control their financial assets and they

(1:12:00) don't like the sense that they're handing a lot of money over to a institution that under certain

(1:12:07) circumstances will you know pay you back but that's years from now. So I think

(1:12:13) you know I think there's a marketing and perception problem and part of the problem is people think of an annuity as

(1:12:18) in an investment when you should think of it as an insurance product and following the principle we discussed

(1:12:24) that you should ensure the large risks not the small ones. Um I would say that deferred payout

(1:12:31) annuities should be more common. So, you know, you retire, maybe you're 65, 67,

(1:12:37) 70, whenever you retire, um, instead of thinking about an annuity that starts paying out immediately,

(1:12:45) think about a much cheaper annuity that will start paying out when you say turn 85, if you do. Um,

(1:12:54) that's going to ensure you against extreme long life, living into your 90s, even your hundreds. um and it'll be more

(1:13:01) affordable and you can retain control of of much of your wealth uh in the meantime. And I think framing it that

(1:13:08) way might might help. Yeah, it's an interesting one. We we have uh there are a couple products that

(1:13:15) I think one of them still exists, one of them failed, I believe, uh that were kind of modeled after taunts, but they

(1:13:21) were mutual funds that you could invest in. So, you still had control of the assets, but there are these mortality credits

(1:13:26) that accumulated. really cool idea, but total flops from a from a product

(1:13:32) perspective. They didn't gather any assets. Yeah. Um, okay.

(1:13:40) What role we touched on this a little bit earlier, but what role do you think technology has has played in improving

() 

(1:13:47) access to finance for ordinary people? Well, I think it's, you know, it's

(1:13:52) lowered, as we were saying earlier, it's lowered the costs of smallcale products. Um, and you know, small investors can do

(1:13:59) things like um, uh, you know, taking out small loans or trading small amounts of

(1:14:05) stock at a lower cost than they would have been able to before. And it provides a new and much more convenient

(1:14:12) interface that you can use to accomplish financial transactions and to shop around. Um, so you know, it's it's

(1:14:21) certainly made some things better. The problem arises because you can also

(1:14:27) um use the attractiveness of the interface to gify um you know bad things

(1:14:33) like day trading stocks for example. Um you know if you're if you're doing it on your smartphone and you know it shows

(1:14:40) you confetti falling when you you know you make a trade or you sell at a profit

(1:14:45) or something. Uh you know that's going to that's going to be fun. um but all too fun and it's going to lead you down

(1:14:52) the wrong path. Um I think we also have to be very mindful of the fact that technology enables price very

(1:14:59) sophisticated price discrimination. So you're going to be shown a price that

(1:15:05) may depend on your online profile and all the data you've inadvertently revealed

(1:15:12) uh by using the internet and social media. And if you are if you look like

(1:15:18) somebody who shops around, you'll be offered a good price. And if you look like somebody who takes the first deal

(1:15:23) you're offered, you'll be offered a ripoff price. And so that's actually very very troubling.

(1:15:31) What are the potential risks of the expansion of FinTech?

(1:15:37) So I think you know there are the consumer risks um that they um exploit

(1:15:43) our psychological biases in a more sophisticated way or they discriminate um algorithmically.

(1:15:50) Um that's on the consumer side. Then on the financial system stability side, you've

(1:15:56) got to worry about um financial activities that migrate outside the

(1:16:03) regulated system and move into a parallel system that's unregulated where we could have, you know, a financial

(1:16:10) crisis blow up. And uh certainly the creation of a parallel crypto system is

(1:16:16) is one place where we we see that happening. Um

(1:16:22) you know the so far the problems with crypto the crypto ecosystem has been small enough that you know big disasters

(1:16:30) like FTX and so forth you know have not really jeopardized the mainstream

(1:16:35) financial system but if we let crypto rip um and we

(1:16:41) have let's say you know let's say many people start to come relying on uh to

(1:16:46) rely on stable coins as a place to keep their emergency mergency funds and the

(1:16:51) stable coin issuers are not sufficiently regulated and they start to make risky

(1:16:57) investments, you can then have a bank run. Um, and

(1:17:02) it's all unregulated. It's like the financial system before the creation of

(1:17:08) the Federal Reserve and the FDIC in this country. Um, so we should certainly be

(1:17:13) worried about that. [Music] What do you think are the main lessons

(1:17:19) from crypto and DeFi so far? Like those those systemic risks that could happen aside, what do you think are the main

(1:17:25) lessons from what has happened to date? Um,

(1:17:33) well, I mean, I've certainly learned that there's a huge appetite for uh these types of financial products.

(1:17:40) Um, I used to think that it was purely an

(1:17:47) appetite for speculative investment. Um, but the recent growth of stable coins is

(1:17:53) a very interesting phenomenon because because stable coins are not speculative investment. They're like they're like

(1:17:59) bank deposits. Um, they typically pay no interest and yet the issuers are earning

(1:18:07) interest. there's a huge deposit franchise there. So, you know, firms like Circle and Tether are making

(1:18:13) enormous profits, especially now that treasury bill rates have come up. Um,

(1:18:19) so why do people like stable coins relative to traditional bank accounts? Uh, you know, I'm still trying to figure

(1:18:26) that out. Maybe it's that they want to have, uh, you know, liquid funds that

(1:18:31) they can use to invest in crypto when they feel like it. Maybe it's distrust of the traditional banking system, sort

(1:18:38) of disillusionment. Um, but I think understanding the source of

(1:18:44) the interest in the market demand for stable coins is an important research topic. I don't think we fully understand

(1:18:50) it yet. And how do you think regulators can both allow innovation at the same time

() 

(1:18:57) protect consumers? It's a tricky balance. Um I think um

(1:19:08) I think we should be uh very much in favor of of innovations that um automate

(1:19:15) traditional procedures, you know, that that take things that were done slowly

(1:19:21) and inefficiently and do them more quickly and more efficiently. Um you know, the the there are certainly

(1:19:26) improvements in the payment system that we needed to see, right? Um, and you

(1:19:32) know, um, whether that's, uh, you know,

(1:19:38) whether that's Venmo, whether it's Zelli, whether it's Wise, which is focusing on, you know, international

(1:19:44) payments. Um, the traditional banking system was extremely slow. There are

(1:19:51) some some countries like Brazil which are introducing very efficient uh,

(1:19:57) government provided digital currencies. Um, so there what you're doing is you're taking something that was notoriously

(1:20:03) slow and inefficient and you're speeding it up. And I think you should uh I don't mean to say let that rip, but certainly

(1:20:09) encourage that. I think I think regulators should be more cautious where somebody says I'm going to do something

(1:20:16) completely new and it's you know it's never been done before but I'm going to do it. Um I think they're um

(1:20:24) trying to allow uh smallcale experiments and see how you know study them and see how they work um and then relax the

(1:20:33) regulation once uh you know you have a proof of concept. I think that's the way to go. One thing that I regret about the

(1:20:43) Trump administration assault on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the US is that the CFPB was doing a lot

(1:20:51) of useful research on how financial products are actually used. And that was

(1:20:56) a valuable source of information that could inform good policy. And so I think shutting that down is a bad idea.

(1:21:07) So maybe more more generally, I mean, we've talked about a lot of the mistakes that

(1:21:13) people make, um the decisions that they maybe should be making if they were perfectly rational. And we've talked

(1:21:19) about how uh capitalists, financial product, financial companies, whatever

(1:21:24) it may be, are pretty good at capitalizing on those mistakes and maybe even pushing people away from what is

(1:21:30) normatively optimal. What role do you think governments should be playing in

() 

(1:21:36) improving how those parties interact and improving the the financial system?

(1:21:41) Okay, so this is the whole last part of our book where we talk about what can be done and we

(1:21:47) we start by acknowledging that governments should try to get the basics right. So there are some very basic

(1:21:52) government functions like providing financial infrastructure, you know, the payment system,

(1:21:59) efficient electronic ownership registries, things of that kind. So we shouldn't forget about the basics. Um

(1:22:05) governments also obviously have a role in um regulating if you like channeling

(1:22:11) the flow of information. You know, financial information can be thought of as a public good. Um so things like the

(1:22:19) the credit reporting system um

(1:22:25) uh and the disclosures that you know need to be made concerning credit products. I mean this is a very

(1:22:31) traditional function going off in the US going back to things like the truth in lending act you know which is from the

(1:22:37) late 1960s. So we should do all of that but then I we think Tun and I think that

(1:22:42) more is needed and it needs to go beyond

(1:22:47) the light touch intervention that's sometimes called nudge. So, nudge if you

(1:22:52) remember was famous book by uh Richard Thaylor and Cass Sunstein and their idea

(1:22:58) was that government could either provide information suggestions or maybe go a little bit further and provide a default

(1:23:05) choice that you would give consumers but then people would be able at almost no cost

(1:23:12) to opt out. And so that's sometimes called um libertarian paternalism

(1:23:18) because you're you're trying to do something in people's interests but you're libertarian because you let them opt out at a minimal minimal cost.

(1:23:27) So nudge was very popular for a while. Uh very fashionable idea. Lots of governments around the world created

(1:23:33) so-called nudge units to study doing this in different contexts. But we argue that as the research has

(1:23:40) come in, uh, what we've learned is that nudges often have short-term effects that look

(1:23:46) promising, but then over time the effects dissipate. So, if you take auto enrollment in a

(1:23:52) retirement savings plan, yes, you can get people to sign up more if you autoenroll them.

(1:23:59) But then there's over time the difference vanishes. The people who weren't initially autoenrolled, they may

(1:24:05) be slow, but they eventually sign up. and the people who were initially autoenrolled, you know, maybe they

(1:24:11) change jobs and then they take the money out. That's a form of leakage. Um, so if

(1:24:18) the ultimate goal is to get adequate retirement saving, it turns out that nudges don't work as well as was

(1:24:25) initially advertised. So we argue that governments need to go further and we call this shove. Be more

(1:24:32) aggressive than nudge. Actually give the system a shove. And what we mean by that is

(1:24:38) we think government should focus on product design. We've talked a lot in this podcast about good product design

(1:24:46) versus bad product design. And we think that regulators, there needs to be a consumer financial regulator, a a single

(1:24:53) body that focuses on this aspect of the financial system. And it should be forward-looking and it

(1:24:59) should say, "Look, a good product would look like such and such. Let's make sure that the good product is

(1:25:06) available. Now, how do you do that? We we argue

(1:25:12) that in each segment of the financial industry, there should be a simple product. We

(1:25:18) call it a starter kit product that people should naturally start with. And

(1:25:23) the regulator should define the terms of the product. not set the fees necessarily, but define the units in

(1:25:30) which the fees are expressed and the terms and conditions. And financial firms that are active in

(1:25:36) that segment of the market, they can offer other products. We're not trying to shut off innovation, not trying to

(1:25:42) tell them what to do, but they must offer a product in this category. And the idea is to make it safe, easy to

(1:25:50) use, and easy to shop for. That's critical. uh because if people understand the pricing units, they will

(1:25:57) be more likely to shop on the basis of price. So we make the analogy with over-the-counter medications. Um you

(1:26:04) know in in the modern regulated health care system, there are certain products that

(1:26:11) are simple enough that people can just go into the pharmacy and buy them and they're efficacious

(1:26:17) and they are sold um on the basis of price. So you you have a headache, you

(1:26:22) go into the pharmacy, you look on the shelf, you can buy Advil or you can buy the generic pharmacy brand. The bottles

(1:26:29) are right next to each other. The size of the pill is the same. In each case, you take two pills. The price

(1:26:37) per pill is on the shelf and you can shop. Maybe you like the brand, maybe you want to save money, but it's easy to

(1:26:42) shop for. And so price competition, which we were talking about earlier, actually works in that environment.

(1:26:50) Um and so we think this could be done with financial products as well.

(1:26:59) Where is the line where regulation has gone too far?

() 

(1:27:05) So we think there are two temptations that governments need to avoid. So one

(1:27:11) temptation is to have a vague uh a vague consumer duty

(1:27:19) which amounts to imposing fiduciary duty on the whole financial system. This is where you say and and the the FCA the

(1:27:26) financial conduct authority in the UK at one point moved a little bit too much in this direction. I think you basically

(1:27:32) say to the big banks and other institutions, you need to treat your customers right and we will decide

(1:27:40) whether you've done that and if you haven't treated them right, we're going to come in and find you billions of pounds or billions of dollars and also

(1:27:47) shame you publicly, but we're not going to tell you in advance what what

(1:27:52) misconduct is. And understandably, businesses hate that. They want to know

(1:27:58) what the rules are so they can follow the rules. Um but a sort of consumer duty or fiduciary duty on the whole

(1:28:05) industry is too vague and what it will produce is a kind of safety culture that's very um dominated by lawyers and

(1:28:14) you know sort of cover your ass and you'll you'll choke off innovation um and it'll be expensive. So there's a

(1:28:21) backlash against this now, particularly in the UK, there's a backlash, but I think part of what the Trump administration has been doing is also a

(1:28:28) backlash against this. Now, the other thing that we think

(1:28:33) um government shouldn't do is get directly into the business of financial service provision.

(1:28:40) Certainly in the old days there were things like postal savings offered by post offices. Um there are certain

(1:28:48) functions that governments do directly like uh hand out student loans in the UK

(1:28:53) and Australia that's a direct government function. So there are one or two exceptions but basically finance today

(1:29:00) is an IT business. It's a big complicated software product and

(1:29:07) governments are notoriously bad at running big complicated software products.

(1:29:12) you know, you go over budget, the uh the thing doesn't work when it's rolled out.

(1:29:18) Um, you know, the reform of health care of armor in the US, it almost collapsed uh

(1:29:25) when the healthcare.gov website didn't work when it was first rolled out. Um,

(1:29:31) you have uh you have scandals in the UK. There's the the infamous Horizon scandal, which

(1:29:38) is the British post office that had accounting software that wrongly identified fraud by a number of the post

(1:29:46) office franchises. A terrible scandal. I mean, people were unjustly accused. There were people who

(1:29:52) killed themselves. Um, and this was the result of a of of uh a big government

(1:29:58) agency buying accounting software from a big company, rolling it out, not monitoring it, and assuming it was

(1:30:05) correct when it wasn't. So, we think that the track record of direct

(1:30:10) government uh administration of of big IT projects is very poor. Um,

(1:30:18) so we would say governments should stick to a few things. maybe student loans um

(1:30:24) you know social sec the social security system in the US works well uh but sort

(1:30:29) of stick to your knitting and don't try to take over the financial industry um so we contrast our proposals with

(1:30:37) that we say have limited regulation that specifies certain products that should be offered

(1:30:45) um and then enforce enforce the offering of those products and and leave it at

(1:30:53) What what what specific areas do you want to see? Like you mentioned the shove. Uh what what specific areas do

(1:30:59) you want to see more forceful regulation in? Well, we think retirement accounts. We think there certainly in the US the main

(1:31:06) problem is access. So, we'd like to see, for example, the creation of a universal retirement account that is opened when

(1:31:13) you first start working and that you can carry with you your whole life. Um,

(1:31:18) without all the complicated rollover provisions that that exist uh now. Um,

(1:31:24) and that's actually an area where we think people should be required to choose one. U, so we don't always

(1:31:29) advocate that, but in important cases, we think it's it's okay to go that far.

(1:31:35) Um we think that transaction accounts could also be reformed. Um the the the

(1:31:43) current system confuses people who don't understand interest and they think they have free

(1:31:50) checking. They're actually paying it by losing the interest. So we think that transactions accounts should pay money

(1:31:56) market interest rates but then charge explicit fees that that come out of the

(1:32:01) interest. um that will allow them to adapt automatically to changes in market

(1:32:07) rates but also make the fees more salient to everyone and then people will shop around and find the the lowest

(1:32:13) fees. Uh so certainly retirement accounts, transactions accounts uh but

(1:32:18) also insurance products um uh that insurance is is a big industry and it

(1:32:24) covers a multitude of things from you know catastrophe insurance against

(1:32:30) natural disasters. You know this is more and more important in the world of climate change. um everything from that

(1:32:36) to annuities which we discussed um life insurance. Um

(1:32:44) we we have a lot of ideas and it would take too long to go through them all. Uh but what what we do in the last chapter

(1:32:50) of the book is we sort of march through the financial system describing many

(1:32:56) many of the products where we we've seen problems and suggesting some uh some

(1:33:01) solutions. So, what main principles would you follow in designing a better financial

() 

(1:33:08) system? Well, we we come up with uh four principles. They sound a little bit

(1:33:15) like, you know, four of the Disney Seven Dwarfves, I have to say. You know, we call them um uh simple, uh cheap, safe,

(1:33:24) and easy. Easy, not sneezy.

(1:33:29) Um but um you know those principles reinforce one another. So simple makes

(1:33:37) it easy to shop. So um that will promote cheap. Simple also makes it um easier

(1:33:44) for people to manage. So simple will promote easy. Um uh people will be less

(1:33:51) likely to make mistakes if a product is simple. So that will also help with safe

(1:33:57) uh and so forth. We think these are we we think these are reinforcing uh principles but th those are those are

(1:34:02) what we we have our eye on. Yeah. Very nice very nice set of words

(1:34:09) of principles. Uh you you alluded to a starter kit of financial products earlier. What what goes in the ideal

(1:34:15) starter kit of financial products in your view? Well, we think uh you know first of all

(1:34:20) a transaction account which I I was discussing a few minutes ago. Uh secondly, a savings account

(1:34:28) um which can be used for things like uh receiving tax refunds and helping to build up a an emergency fund. Uh third,

(1:34:36) a retirement account which can be used to start risky investing.

(1:34:42) Um and then uh fourth a a set of in of suitable insurance products which are

(1:34:48) going to be linked to where people are in the life cycle and and people's needs. Now of course within these

(1:34:55) different accounts you can also have other financial products like target day funds which I was uh talking about

(1:35:01) earlier. Um we uh we also think that credit

(1:35:08) availability is important for the cases the situations where people do exhaust their emergency funds and we think the

(1:35:15) principle there is that it's important to link credit to

(1:35:20) people's ability to repay. So credit shouldn't be linked to your

(1:35:26) desire to spend. We're not in favor of buy now pay later credit because that encourages impulse spending. We are in

(1:35:33) favor of paycheck advance programs which make the timing of when you get your paycheck a little more flexible because

(1:35:40) that's tied to your employment and hence your ability to repay. Um we also think

(1:35:46) that it's desirable to allow people to borrow um in certain circumstances against the value of their retirement

(1:35:53) account. Uh but that has to be very carefully structured.

(1:35:59) Yeah, makes sense. So you and you and Terran have put together really an incredible analysis of the financial

(1:36:06) system of its its shortcomings as it exists now uh and and some proposed

(1:36:12) solutions. Where does you you've written the book obviously, but where does something like this go next? Like how

(1:36:17) does this stuff actually happen? And and how will the two of you measure the success of your efforts?

() 

(1:36:25) So, uh you know, where we're going next is is trying to talk a lot about the book and trying to get the media to pay

(1:36:31) attention. U I'm grateful to you for having me on Rational Reminder, you know, but I'm trying to do a lot of

(1:36:37) these things and so is Tun. Um and we're trying to get the world to pay attention. It's obviously a very noisy

(1:36:43) world with a lot going on. So, it can be hard to get that attention. But that's our our first move. Now, in terms of

(1:36:50) implementation, you know, we're realistic about the fact that um there's a political cycle, and I

(1:36:58) don't think it's realistic to expect any kind of financial regulation really in the next couple of years in the US given

(1:37:05) where we're at. But we, as I mentioned, we take a global perspective. different

(1:37:10) countries are at different places politically and there may be many places where some actions along these lines can

(1:37:18) begin to happen. Um but we hope to have a gradual long-term

(1:37:24) influence by putting clearly in people's minds what the goals of financial

(1:37:29) regulation are. And again, it shouldn't be about coming in and saying to the financial industry,

(1:37:35) you've been bad. We're going to punish you because you were bad. I think one

(1:37:40) problem is that a lot of consumer financial regulation came in after the global financial crisis at a time when

(1:37:47) lots of people had this vague sense that the financial industry was was bad and should be punished. That's not at all

(1:37:54) what we're talking about. We're talking about design, intelligent design, and we hope that by getting that in people's

(1:38:00) heads over time good things can happen. Now, how will we measure that? Well,

(1:38:06) that's what the academic field of household finance does. A field of research that's developed a lot in the

(1:38:12) last 20 25 years. It's a big part of academic finance today and I think it's

(1:38:18) very valuable research. It's fascinating, but it's also practically important. So, we now have ways to

(1:38:25) measure all kinds of different outcomes. You know, how many people are letting their insurance policies lapse uh at

(1:38:31) just the wrong moment? How many people have not saved enough for retirement? um how many people are buying dominated

(1:38:38) health insurance plans? Um how many people are paying, you know, multiple overdraft charges on their bank

(1:38:44) accounts? Or how many people are paying late fees on credit cards even if even though they're paying more than the

(1:38:51) minimum on another card and so they could obviously afford to avoid the late fee. We can measure these sorts of

(1:38:56) things, but we can also measure price dispersion. So another place we might

(1:39:02) look is we might look to see how many uh expensive ripoff index funds are being offered. An index fund is a standardized

(1:39:09) product. If you see an index fund being sold with a fee of 50 60 70 basis

(1:39:16) points, that's too much. That should not be able to survive in the marketplace.

(1:39:21) So there's a lot of research and I think it's a very valuable function of the academic finance community to study this

(1:39:28) stuff. and write papers about it and then maybe every now and again someone will come

(1:39:34) along and write a book to summarize it. I don't know if I will have another book

(1:39:39) in me but uh if not me then perhaps uh somebody else will will write the book in a few years so we can see what

(1:39:46) progress we've made. Did did you did you kind of kick off the

(1:39:51) whole field of household finance with your presidential address for the uh American Finance Association? I wouldn't

(1:39:57) claim to have kicked it off. I would claim to have seen a trend and labeled it and encouraged it. You know, uh the

(1:40:05) work was happening. It was a bit scattered. People didn't necessarily see

(1:40:11) how it fit together or where it was headed. And so I tried to pull things together and I gave the talk a name that

(1:40:20) was then picked up as the name of the academic field. So within academia, we talk about household finance. We have

(1:40:27) household finance conferences. But you know in the outside world we

(1:40:32) might talk about personal finance. That's the the part of the title of our book. Uh might the course I teach at

(1:40:39) Harvard is called personal finance. And then people also talk about consumer finance as in the consumer financial

(1:40:45) protection bureau. Um so different words are used. I was really trying to label

(1:40:51) what was emerging and encourage it and I I think I achieved it. But I would certainly not claim to have kicked it

(1:40:57) off. Okay. No, it makes sense. Well, even still, the fact that you kind of maybe

(1:41:03) gave it a name and and put people put people in the same direction, started moving people in the same direction toward what has become a pretty

(1:41:10) significant field of study. Um, makes it quite fitting for you to have written this book, which again is kind of tying

(1:41:15) the whole thing together and showing here's what we know from all this research that's happened since then, and

(1:41:20) here's what we can actually do with it. Great. Well, thank you. I uh I'm glad you like the book and I really enjoyed

(1:41:27) being able to talk about it. So, thank you for having me. Thanks a lot, John. This was great.

(1:41:32) Great conversation, John. Thank you. [Music]
