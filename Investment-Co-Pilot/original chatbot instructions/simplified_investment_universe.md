# Approved Investment Universe for Asset Allocation (IPS)

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-28
**Status:** Active (Simplified)
**Focus:** Global Investors (US & European Domicile)

This document defines the **Essential Investment Universe** for the Asset Allocation Agent. It filters out noise to focus on **Simple, Cheap, and Safe** building blocks required to execute the "Core" strategies defined in the IPS.

*Based on principles from "Fixed: Why Personal Finance Is Broken and How to Make It Work for Everyone" by Campbell & Ramadorai.*

## 1. The Core "Must Haves"

These assets are "really necessary" to build a diversified, passive portfolio (The "Core").

### **A. Equity (Growth Engines)**
*Rule 6: "Own the whole market."*

| Role | **US Investor (Ticker)** | **European Investor (UCITS)** | **Rationale** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The One-Stop Shop** | **VT** (Vanguard Total World) | **VWCE** (Vanguard All-World Acc) | **Simplest solution.** Owns ~9,000 stocks globally. No rebalancing needed between regions. |

#### **ESG Equity (The "Responsible" One-Stop Shop)**

For ESG-focused investors, the agent uses a **global ESG equity core** instead of the standard VT/VWCE building blocks.

| Role | **US Investor (Ticker)** | **European Investor (UCITS)** | **Rationale** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Responsible One-Stop Shop** | **ESGV (65%) + VSGX (35%)** (Vanguard ESG US + Intl) | **V3AA** (Vanguard ESG Global All Cap) | Sustainable global exposure excluding fossil fuels, nuclear, vice, weapons, and UN Global Compact violators. V3AA is a single global All-Cap fund (~6,000 stocks globally). US investors must replicate this manually; a roughly **65/35** US/International split is market-cap neutral today (60/40 is a common approximation). |

**Key Details:**

- **V3AA (Europe):** Tracks the *FTSE Global All Cap Choice Index* (Large, Mid, **and Small Caps**). Strictly excludes vice sectors, weapons, non-renewable energy (fossil fuels, nuclear), and UN Global Compact violators.
- **ESGV + VSGX (US):** Vanguard does not offer a single “Global ESG” ETF in the US. A ~60/40 combination of ESGV (US) and VSGX (International) approximates VT with similar ESG exclusion criteria.

### **B. Fixed Income (Safety & Survival)**
*Rule 1: "Consumption Smoothing" & Rule 2: "Human Capital is a Bond".*

| Role | **US Investor (Ticker)** | **European Investor (UCITS)** | **Rationale** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Yield Booster** | **LQD** (Inv Grade Corp) | **LQDA** (iShares $ Corp Bond) / **IEAA** (iShares Euro Corp Bond) | Diversified investment‑grade corporate bond exposure to boost income above government bonds. LQDA holds USD credit; IEAA is the EUR‑denominated alternative for investors who explicitly want Euro corporate bonds. Both carry higher credit risk and stronger correlation with equity drawdowns than government bonds. |

## 2. The "Fun Bucket" & Hedges

These are **not** strictly necessary for survival, but serve specific psychological (Rule 7) or hedging roles (Rule 5).

### **Speculation & Insurance**
*Rule 5: "Insure Catastrophes" & Rule 7: "Separation of Church and State".*

| Asset | **US Investor** | **European Investor** | **Role** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gold** | **GLD** (SPDR Gold) | **SGLD** (Invesco Physical Gold) | **Insurance (Hedge).** Against currency debasement or extreme fear. |
| **Bitcoin** | **IBIT** (iShares Bitcoin) | **BTCE** (VanEck Bitcoin) | **Speculation (Fun).** For the "Gambler" persona. **Max 50% allocation.** (Warning: High risk, high volatility). |

## 3. Excluded / Deprecated Assets

The following have been **removed** to adhere to the principles in *Fixed: Why Personal Finance Is Broken and How to Make It Work for Everyone* (Simple & Safe):

*   ❌ **Single Country ETFs (EWU, EWG, etc.):** Picking countries is active management (market timing) and adds complexity/fees.
*   ❌ **Thematic ETFs (Cannabis, AI, Robotics):** High fee, high risk, performance chasing. (Violates Rule 3).
*   ❌ **Leveraged / Inverse ETFs:** Violates "Safe" (protects from ruin).
*   ❌ **Niche Real Estate (REITs):** Homeowners already have huge real estate exposure (Rule 4).
