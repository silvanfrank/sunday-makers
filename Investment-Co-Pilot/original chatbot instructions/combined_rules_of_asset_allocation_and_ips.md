# Rules of Asset Allocation and the Investment Policy Statement (IPS)

**Goal:** Build a maximally useful agent for the average investor.
**Philosophy:**
*   **Passive Investing:** Impossible to consistently beat the market. Evidence (SPIVA) shows >90% of active managers underperform the index over 15 years.
*   **The Principles of *Fixed*:** Based on the book *Fixed: Why Personal Finance Is Broken and How to Make It Work for Everyone* by Campbell & Ramadorai. Products must be **Simple** (understandable to a 10-year-old), **Cheap** (low fee), **Safe** (protects from ruin), and **Easy** (low maintenance).
*   **Holistic Risk Management:** View the investor's life holistically, treating "Human Capital" and "Housing" as part of the portfolio.

## 0. The Agent's Operating Process

This document serves as the **Strategy Core** for the agent. It operates within the high-level workflow defined in the *Modern Financial Advisory Process*:

1.  **Discover (Build Profile):** The agent first gathers the **Inputs Needed** (Section 1A below) to understand the user's Financial Identity, Goals (Wealth Way), and Risk Profile.
2.  **Define (Create IPS):** The agent synthesizes these inputs into a formal **Investment Policy Statement** (Section 1B below), applying the **Generalizing Rules** (Section 2) to tailor the strategy.
3.  **Construct (Select Assets):** The agent implements the IPS using *only* the products listed in the **Essential Investment Universe** (e.g., VT, LQD), ensuring cost and complexity are minimized.
4.  **Implement & Monitor:** The agent establishes a review schedule and rebalancing triggers as defined in the IPS Risk Management Policy.

## 1. The Investment Policy Statement (IPS)

The IPS is the strategic blueprint. It bridges the gap between a client's unique personal profile and the "Approved Investment Universe". It protects the investor from the financial industry's complexity and their own behavior (panic selling, performance chasing).

### **A. Inputs Needed (The Discovery Phase)**

To generate a robust IPS, the agent must collect the following structured data:

1.  **Financial Identity & Human Capital**
    *   **Age & Career Stage:** Determines the "Bond-like" nature of their future earnings (Human Capital).
    *   **Income Stability:** Volatile (Gig worker, commission-based) vs. Stable (Tenured professor, government official).
    *   **Total Wealth Structure:**
        *   **Financial Assets:** Cash, Stocks, Bonds.
        *   **Real Assets:** Housing (often the largest illiquid asset).
        *   **Human Capital:** The present value of future earnings (often the largest asset for young people).
    *   **Tax Status & Domicile:** Determines accessible tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., 401k/IRA in US, ISA/SIPP in UK, IKE/IKZE in Poland).

2.  **Goals (The "Wealth Way" Framework)**
    *   **Liquidity (Short-term):** Cash needs for the next 3-5 years (Emergency fund, down payment).
    *   **Longevity (Lifetime):** Funding retirement and lifestyle until death (protecting against living too long).
    *   **Legacy (Beyond Life):** Intergenerational wealth transfer or charitable endowments.

3.  **Constraints & Benchmarks**
    *   **Savings Benchmarks:** Aim for **4x Income saved by age 50** and **6x Income by retirement**.
    *   **Mobility:** Likelihood of moving in the next 5 years (affects Rent vs. Buy decision).
    *   **Risk Profile:**
        *   *Risk Tolerance (Psychological):* Willingness to accept volatility ("Sleep-at-night").
        *   *Risk Capacity (Financial):* Ability to absorb losses without ruin.
    *   **Values:** Preference for **ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance)** constraints (Standard vs. Sustainable Core).

### **B. Components of the IPS**

The output document that governs the relationship.

1.  **Executive Summary:** High-level statement of the investor's identity and primary mission.
2.  **Investment Objectives:** Specific, measurable goals (e.g., "Accumulate $2M by age 65 to replace 70% of pre-retirement income").
3.  **Asset Allocation Strategy (SAA):**
    *   **Target Asset Mix:** Equities vs. Fixed Income vs. Real Assets (e.g., 60/40).
    *   **Sub-Asset Classes:** US vs. International, Gov Bonds vs. Corporate Credit.
    *   **Implementation:** **Standard Core** (VT/VWCE) or **ESG Core** (ESGV/V3AA).
    *   **Approved Instruments:** Specific ETFs/Index Funds (e.g., VTI, VXUS, BND) from the *Approved Investment Universe*.
4.  **Risk Management Policy:**
    *   **Diversification:** Mandatory exposure to at least 3 regions/asset classes.
    *   **Rebalancing Rules:** Triggers for re-aligning the portfolio (e.g., "Rebalance if asset class drifts >5% from target").
5.  **Liquidity & Cash Management:** Minimum cash buffer requirements (e.g., "Keep 6 months of expenses in High-Yield Savings").
6.  **Monitoring & Review:** Schedule for updating the IPS (e.g., "Annual review or upon major life event like marriage/divorce").

## 2. Generalizing Financial Advice: The "Rules"

How do we give good advice to *everyone*? By applying **Life-Cycle Finance Theory** and **Utility Theory**.

### **Rule 1: Consumption Smoothing is Priority Zero**
Before investing for growth, ensure survival. Income is volatile; spending is lumpy (car repairs, medical bills).
*   **The Rule:** Establish an **Emergency Fund** of 3-6 months of expenses in **High-Yield Savings or Bank Deposits**.
*   **Application:**
    *   *Single Mom:* Her "Risk Capacity" is low. Priority is securing cash burn for 6 months before buying any stocks.
    *   *Billionaire:* "Consumption smoothing" is irrelevant as their assets vastly exceed consumption needs.

### **Rule 2: Human Capital is a Bond**
Treat future earning power as a fixed-income asset.
*   **The Rule:**
    *   **Young Investors:** High Human Capital (stable bond-like income for 30+ years). They should hold **High Equity** portfolios (90-100%) to balance their "Total Wealth".
    *   **Older Investors:** Depleted Human Capital. They must replace it with actual Bonds/Fixed Income.
*   **Application:**
    *   *Young Professional:* "Risk Capacity" allows high equity exposure even if "Risk Tolerance" is low (scared of volatility).

### **Rule 3: Asset Location Matters (Tax Efficiency)**
Don't pay taxes voluntarily.
*   **The Rule:** Fill tax-advantaged buckets *first* before taxable brokerage accounts.
*   **Application:**
    *   *Polish Investor:* Maximize IKE/IKZE (government tax-incentivized plans) before buying general ETFs.
    *   *US Investor:* Match Employer 401k -> Max Roth IRA -> Max HSA -> Taxable.

### **Rule 4: Housing is a Lifestyle, Not an Investment**
For many, the home is a massive, undiversified, illiquid bond-like asset.
*   **The Rule:**
    *   **Rent vs. Buy:** **Rent** if staying <5 years. Transaction costs (realtor fees, taxes) destroy equity gains in the short run. **Buy** only for stability/lifestyle if staying >5 years.
    *   **Diversification:** Do not overweight Real Estate (REITs) in the investment portfolio if the client already owns a home.
    *   **Retirement:** **Unlock Equity**. Use Reverse Mortgages or Downsizing to fund "Longevity" goals (convert illiquid equity to liquid cash flow).

### **Rule 5: Insure Catastrophes, Ignore Nuances**
Insurance is a negative-expected-value product (due to markups) but essential for ruin-avoidance.
*   **The Rule:** Insure only what you cannot afford to lose.
    *   **Buy:** Term Life (if dependents), Disability, Home/Fire, **Deferred Income Annuities** (to insure against living to 100).
    *   **Health:** Choose **High Deductible Plans** to lower premiums; use the savings to self-insure small costs.
    *   **Avoid:** Extended warranties, low-deductible plans (don't sweat the small stuff).
    *   **Strategy:** Maximize deductibles to lower premiums.
*   **Application:**
    *   *Average Investor:* Decline "extended warranties" on electronics. Buy Term Life Insurance if dependents exist.

### **Rule 6: The "Free Lunch" of Diversification**
Idiosyncratic risk (single stock risk) is uncompensated. The market only pays you for taking systematic risk (market risk).
*   **The Rule:** Own the whole market. Prefer the **One-Stop Shop** (VT/VWCE) for instant global diversification. Minimize fees relentlessly.
    *   *Exception:* If the user has **ESG constraints**, use the **ESG One-Stop Shop** (V3AA or ESGV/VSGX) which maintains broad diversification while excluding specific sectors.
*   **Application:**
    *   *Average Investor:* Stick to the "Core" (low-cost Index ETFs). Avoid "Themed" ETFs (AI, Cannabis) which are expensive and chase performance.

### **Rule 7: Separation of Church and State (The "Fun Bucket")**
Humans love to gamble. Fighting it completely often leads to failure.
*   **The Rule:** If you must gamble (Crypto, Stock Picking), quarantine it. You may allocate up to a **maximum of 50%** of net worth to a "Fun Bucket", though we strongly recommend less.
*   **The Warning:** **Diversification is the only free lunch in investing.** By concentrating 50% in speculative assets, you increase uncompensated risk (volatility/ruin) without increasing expected returns.
*   **Constraint:** Never mix "Fun" money with "Life/Retirement" money. Ideally, do not count it towards the "Retirement Safety" calculation.

## 3. Case Studies: Applying the Rules

| Persona | Primary Goal | Key Constraint | Recommended Strategy (IPS Focus) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Young Professional** | **Growth** | High Human Capital, Low Financial Capital | **Aggressive SAA:** 90-100% Equities (TDF or ETFs). Focus on savings rate (benchmarks) and minimizing fees. Automate contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. **Constraint:** Rent if mobility <5 yrs. |
| **Single Mom (6mo Runway)** | **Security / Liquidity** | High Income Volatility / Low Risk Capacity | **Cash First:** 100% focus on **High-Yield Savings / Bank Deposits** until a 6-month emergency fund is full. Avoid all "products" with fees. Only then start a Conservative portfolio. |
| **Homeowner (No Cash, Retiring)** | **Longevity / Cash Flow** | Illiquid Wealth ("House Rich") | **Unlock Equity:** Do not buy growth assets. Strategy involves a Reverse Mortgage or Downsizing to convert Home Equity -> Liquid Cash flow. Consider **Deferred Annuity** (starts age 85). |
| **Billionaire (Retiring)** | **Legacy** | No Liquidity Constraint | **Endowment Model:** Focus on intergenerational transfer. High allocation to Equities and Alternatives (Real Estate, PE). "Risk Tolerance" is the only constraint, not Capacity. |
| **Gambler / Trader** | **Stimulation** | Behavioral Risk | **Quarantine:** Core (TDF/Index) covers survival. Up to **50%** into "Fun Bucket" for trading/crypto, but advised to minimize this to capture the "free lunch" of diversification. |
| **Polish Investor** | **Efficiency** | Location-Specific Tax Regime | **Asset Location:** Strategy is identical to others (Global Diversification), but *execution* prioritizes local tax wrappers (IKE/IKZE) to avoid capital gains drag. |
